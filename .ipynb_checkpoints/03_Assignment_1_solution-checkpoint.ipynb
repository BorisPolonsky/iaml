    "## Description of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is based on the 20 Newsgroups Dataset. This dataset is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups, each corresponding to a different topic. Some of the newsgroups are very closely related to each other (e.g. comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware, comp.sys.mac.hardware), while others are highly unrelated (e.g misc.forsale, soc.religion.christian). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three versions of the 20 Newsgroups Dataset. In this assignment we will use the `bydate` matlab version in which documents are sorted by date into training (60%) and test (40%) sets, newsgroup-identifying headers are dropped and duplicates are removed. This collection comprises roughly 61,000 different words, which results in a bag-of-words representation with frequency counts. More specifically, each document is represented by a 61,000 dimensional vector that contains the counts for each of the 61,000 different words present in the respective document. \n",
    "\n",
    "To save you time and to make the problem manageable with limited computational resources, we preprocessed the original dataset. We will use documents from only 5 out of the 20 newsgroups, which results in a 5-class problem. More specifically the 5 classes correspond to the following newsgroups: \n",
    "1. `alt.atheism`\n",
    "2. `comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware`\n",
    "3. `comp.sys.mac.hardware`\n",
    "4. `rec.sport.baseball`\n",
    "5. `rec.sport.hockey `\n",
    "\n",
    "However, note here that classes 2-3 and 4-5 are rather closely related. Additionally, we computed the mutual information of each word with the class attribute and selected the 520 words out of 61,000 that had highest mutual information. Therefore, our dataset is a $N \\times 520$ dimensional matrix, where $N$ is the number of documents. For very sophisticated technical reasons 1 was added to all the word counts in part A. The resulting representation is much more compact and can be used directly to perform our experiments in Python."

One problem with Gaussian NB is that it assumes gaussian densities, although we know that our variables are discrete-valued (so we expect them to follow Poisson distributions). Another problem is that the Naive Bayes assumption doesn't hold for text data (i.e. we wouldn't expect that the frequence of words are conditionally independent given the label of the document)."
